# DDHub Semantic Interoperability
Repository for the DDHub semantical model. The main feature of this repo is the ontology. 
Corresponds to the *Work Package 1* of the DSID project. 

The DDHub scope can be found [here](docs/DDHub_semantic_model.md).

Some uses cases can be found [here](docs/use_cases/Use_cases.md). 

Some descriptions of typical drilling signals used for creating the semantical model can be found [here](docs/drilling_signals/home.md). 

Some early architecture can be found [here](docs/architecture/DDHub_architecture.md). 

The DDHub ontology can be found [here for the xml serialization](model/DDHub_xml.owl). Auto-generated documentation is [there](model/html/documentation/index-en.html), but it does not display well in the browser. 

Vocabulary development takes place [here](docs/vocabulary_development/vocabulary_development.md).
