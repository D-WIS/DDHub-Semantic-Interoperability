# Definition sets
## ADCS<!-- DEFINITION SET HEADER -->
- Description: 
this definition set refers to the various functions an ADCS implements. It is to be used for the ADCS capability description.

## AdvisorySystemAdvice<!-- DEFINITION SET HEADER -->
- Description: 
this is the part associated to advices provided by advisory systems.

## ContextualData<!-- DEFINITION SET HEADER -->
- Description: 
This category defines the vocabulary to describe contextual data.

## DataDependencies<!-- DEFINITION SET HEADER -->
- Description: 
this definition set covers the physical dependence of a `DrillingDatPoint` on something else.

## DataFlow<!-- DEFINITION SET HEADER -->
- Description: 
this category refers to the data processing. It should probably be renamed accordingly. It should define and organize the different types of processing encountered during drilling operations. A Thursday session was devoted to those items. Note that in the current version, control flow is also included: a controller is seen as a special type of processing unit, that generates commands based on measurements and set-points. This can of course be modified if deemed necessary. Note also that transmission is included there as well. A telemetry system is seen as a processing unit that only duplicates a signal, and a delay is associated to the duplication process. While this is a useful way of looking at telemetry, it is probably not intuitive enough.

## DataProviders<!-- DEFINITION SET HEADER -->
- Description: 
description of the different actors involved in the well construction process

## DataTransmission<!-- DEFINITION SET HEADER -->
- Description: 
this category contains all nouns and verbs used to describe the rig's telemetry, for each signal. Downhole telemetry has focus.

- Display name: FDIR Function
- Parent class: [ProtectionFunction](#ProtectionFunction)
- Description: 
A `FDIRFunction` is a `ProtectionFunction` that reacts to a particular state of the drilling process. FDIR
stands for Fault Detection, Isolation and Recovery. An FDIR protects the drilling process by looking at its outputs.
When that state is detected, then an isolation procedure is run, and if successful and defined, a recovery procedure is
thereafter executed. In case of success of the recovery procedure, the drilling process is resumed. In all other cases,
the system returns in manual mode, usually using the safe mode management procedure. An example of `FDIRFunction` is an
packoff detection and reaction procedure.

## DrillingFaultDetectionIsolationAndRecoveryAdvice <!-- NOUN -->
- Display name: Drilling Fault Detection Isolation and Recovery Advice
- Parent class: [AdvisorySystemAdvice](#AdvisorySystemAdvice)
- Description: 
A fault detection, isolation and recovery (FDIR) advisor provides information on how to detect an drilling incident
and parameters to procedure that is executed when a drilling incident is detected in order to first to isolate the drilling incident
and then possibly recover from that incident.
- Definition set: AdvisorySystemAdvice
- Examples:
A pack-off FDIR function detects an abornormal dowhole pressure and executes a procedure to avoid fracturing the
open hole formation and possibly continues with a procedure to remediate the cause of the pack-off and return to normal conditions.

An overpull/underpull function detects an abnormal hook-load either while moving upward (overpull) or downward (underpull).
It reacts to the situation by stopping the axial movement and possibly starts other actions to remediate for the cause of the abnormal
hook-load with the objective to return to normal conditions.

An overtorque FDIR function reacts to abnormal torque conditions. The rotation is stopped and possibly counter measures
are applied to remediate the cause of the overtorque with the objective to return to normal conditions.

- Description: 
**Acceleration** is defined as the rate of change of velocity with respect to time. Velocity itself is the rate of change of displacement (or position) with respect to time. Therefore, acceleration is the rate of change of displacement twice with respect to time.
Let's break this down:
1. **Displacement** (or position) has the dimension of **Length(L)**.
2. **Velocity** is displacement per unit time:
$$\text{Velocity} = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{L}{T}$$
So, the dimension of velocity is **$[L T^{ -1}]$**.
3. **Acceleration** is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time:
$$\text{Acceleration} = \frac{\text{Velocity}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{L T^{ -1}}{T} = L T ^{-2}$$
Therefore, the dimension of acceleration is $[LT^{-2}]$.

- Parent class: [DWISNoun](#DWISNoun)
- Attributes:
  - MeaningfulPrecision
    - Type: double
    - Description: 
- Description: 
Represents a quantity that allows meaningful comparisons.
A `MeasurableQuantity` is related to a Quantity using the `HasMeasurableQuantity` relation and its reciprocal
relation called `IsOfBaseQuantity`.
Context dependence: for example, Fluid density and Equivalent Circulating Density are represented 
as two different "Measurable quantities", although they both refer to the same base SI quantities. 
Typical sub-types of `MeasurableQuantity` are provided in MeasurableQuantityTypes. These types
can be used in a sort of singleton pattern, i.e., it is not necessary to create an individual to use them
in a relation. Also, if individuals are created with the same characteristics, they are considered as being 
multiple representations of the same `Noun`. The list of `MeasurableQuantity` in MeasurableQuantityTypes is automatically generated
from the `PhysicalQuantities` defined in the Open Source Drilling Community ([OSDC](https://opensourcedrilling.org/)) project called `UnitConversion` 
(see [`OSDC UnitConversion`](https://github.com/Open-Source-Drilling-Community/UnitConversion)). Only the
physical quantities for which a `MeaningfulPrecision` has beed defined are used to generate MeasurableQuantityTypes. 
It is possible to look at all the physical quantities defined in the `OSDC UnitConversion` project by
using the web application hosted here: [`OSDC Physical Quantity Web App`](https://dev.digiwells.no/UnitConversion/webapp/PhysicalQuantity).

- Description: 
A `Quantity` represents a physical quantity. A `Quantity` is characterized by its physical dimensions as defined in the SI
International System of units. There are typical sub-types of `Quantity` defined in `QuantityTypes`. These types can be used in a sort of singleton pattern, i.e., it is not necessary to create an individual to use them
in a relation. Also, if individuals are created with the same characteristics, they are considered as being 
multiple representations of the same `Noun`. These typical
sub-types are automatically generated from the `PhysicalQuantities` defined in the Open Source Drilling 
Community ([OSDC](https://opensourcedrilling.org/)) project called `UnitConversion` (see [`OSDC UnitConversion`](https://github.com/Open-Source-Drilling-Community/UnitConversion)).
Only the physical quantities for which a `MeaningfulPrecision` is *not* defined are used to generate 
QuantityTypes. It is possible to look at all the physical quantities defined in the `OSDC UnitConversion` project by
using the web application hosted here: [`OSDC Physical Quantity Web App`](https://dev.digiwells.no/UnitConversion/webapp/PhysicalQuantity).
- Definition set: Quantities
- Examples:
Here is an example making use of a predifined quantity defined in `QuantityTypes`
``` dwis
DrillingSignal:acceleration_signal
DrillingDataPoint:acceleration_1
acceleration_1 HasValue acceleration_signal
acceleration_1 IsOfMeasurableQuantity AccelerationDrillingQuantity
acceleration_signal HasUnitOfMeasure MetrePerSecondSquared
```
An example semantic graph looks like as follow:
```mermaid
graph LR
	N0000[acceleration_signal] -->|BelongsToClass| N0001(DrillingSignal) 
	N0002[acceleration_1] -->|BelongsToClass| N0003(DrillingDataPoint) 
	N0002[acceleration_1] -->|HasValue| N0000((acceleration_signal)) 
	N0002[acceleration_1] -->|IsOfMeasurableQuantity| N0004((AccelerationDrillingQuantity)) 
	N0000[acceleration_signal] -->|HasUnitOfMeasure| N0005((MetrePerSecondSquared)) 
```
And here is an example where the `Quantity` is defined from scratch:
``` dwis
Quantity:linearDisplacementQuantity
linearDisplacement.L = 2
MeasurableQuantity:measurableLinearDisplacementQuantity
measurableLinearDisplacementQuantity.MeaningfulPrecision = 0.001
measurableLinearDisplacementQuantity IsOfBaseQuantity linearDisplacementQuantity
linearDisplacementQuantity HasMeasurableQuantity measurableLinearDisplacementQuantity

## AccelerationQuantity <!-- NOUN -->
- Display name: Acceleration
- Parent class: [Quantity](#Quantity)
- Specialization:
  - L = 1
  - T = -2
- Description: 
**Acceleration** is defined as the rate of change of velocity with respect to time. Velocity itself is the rate of change of displacement (or position) with respect to time. Therefore, acceleration is the rate of change of displacement twice with respect to time.
Let's break this down:
1. **Displacement** (or position) has the dimension of **Length(L)**.
2. **Velocity** is displacement per unit time:
$$\text{Velocity} = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{L}{T}$$
So, the dimension of velocity is **$[L T^{ -1}]$**.
3. **Acceleration** is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time:
$$\text{Acceleration} = \frac{\text{Velocity}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{L T^{ -1}}{T} = L T ^{-2}$$
Therefore, the dimension of acceleration is $[LT^{-2}]$.
The SI unit for **acceleration** is: metre per second squared with the associated unit label $\frac{m}{s^{2}}$

- Description: 
The **angle magnetic flux density** is the product of an angle by a magnetic flux density. Let's break it down step by step:
1. Magnetic Flux Density
The **magnetic flux density** $\mathbf{B}$ is a measure of the strength and direction of the magnetic field at a particular point in space. It represents the amount of magnetic flux passing through a unit area perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field. In simpler terms, it describes how dense or concentrated the magnetic field lines are in a given region.It can be expressed in terms of the fundamental dimensions as:
$$[M][T]^{-2}[I]^{-1}$$

## EnergyQuantity <!-- NOUN -->
- Display name: Energy
- Parent class: [Quantity](#Quantity)
- Specialization:
  - L = 2
  - M = 1
  - T = -2
- Description: 
Energy is the quantitative property that is transferred to a body or to a physical system, recognizable in the performance of work and in the form of heat and light. Energy is a conserved quantity—the law of conservation of energy states that energy can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed; matter and energy may also be converted to one another.
The dimension of energy is:
$$[L^{2}MT^{-2}]$$.
The SI unit for **energy** is: joule with the associated unit label $J$

## MassQuantity <!-- NOUN -->
- Display name: Mass
- Parent class: [Quantity](#Quantity)
- Specialization:
  - M = 1
- Description: 
Mass can be experimentally defined as a measure of the body's inertia, meaning the resistance to acceleration (change of velocity) when a net force is applied. The object's mass also determines the strength of its gravitational attraction to other bodies.
The dimension of mass is:
$$[M]$$.
The SI unit for **mass** is: kilogram with the associated unit label $kg$

- Display name: Is Idling Signal For
- Parent verb: [DWISVerb](#DWISVerb)
- Subject class: [DrillingDataPoint](#DrillingDataPoint)
- Object class: [RunnableFunction](#RunnableFunction)
- Definition set: ADCS
- Description: 
This verb is used to indicate a `DrillingDataPoint` that tells if the function is in an idle state.
A function that is idle must be enabled but does not perform any particular control on the machines. For instance, a 
`ProcedureFunction` that has reached its terminal state or a `ControllerFunction` that cannot control anymore its 
parameter because a limit is reached, e.g., autodriller when reaching the `MinDrillHeightVerticalLocation`, or an FDIR
function when there are no incidents that is detected. A SOE function is in idle state, if the used set-points are
within the limits, but if the limits are applied then the idle state is false, because the function acts on the set-points.

- Display name: Is Alarm Triggered Signal For
- Parent verb: [DWISVerb](#DWISVerb)
- Subject class: [DrillingDataPoint](#DrillingDataPoint)
- Object class: [FDIRFunction](#FDIRFunction)
- Definition set: ADCS
- Description: 
This verb is used to indicate a `DrillingDataPoint` tells whether an `FDIRFunction` has its alarm level
being triggered or not. This signal is expected to be a Boolean value. The signal is expected to be true from the 
moment the FDIR has triggered to the moment it has recovered from the incident, if it has a recovery procedure, or to
the moment the control is given back to the end-user, in case of failure of the recovery procedure or at the end of 
the isolation procedure.

## DWISVerb <!-- VERB -->
- Display name: DWIS verb
- Subject class: [DWISNoun](#DWISNoun)
- Object class: [DWISNoun](#DWISNoun)
- Definition set: DWISSemantics
- Description: 
This is the root class for all verbs defined in the DWIS vocabulary. It is used to define a relation between a subject, which can be of any `DWISNoun` and an object, also of any type of `DWISNoun`.
- Examples:
`DWISVerb` is not really intended to be used directly neither when defining facts nor in sparql queries.
## BelongsToClass <!-- VERB -->
- Display name: Belongs To Class
- Parent verb: [DWISVerb](#DWISVerb)
- Subject class: [DWISNoun](#DWISNoun)
- Object class: [DWISNoun](#DWISNoun)
- Definition set: DWISSemantics
- Description: 
The verb is used between a node and a Noun, i.e., a class. Semantically it can be considered as a synonym to `rdf:type`. It has been introduced to overcome limitations from OPC-UA that does not allow for multiple inheritance. Note that the same node can be in relation using `BelongsToClass` to several classes.
- Examples:
```ddhub
BitDepth:dat#01
DerivedMeasurement:dat#01
BitDepth:dat#02
ComputedData:dat#02
```
In this example, `dat#01` is a `BitDepth` that is a derived measurement, while `dat#02` is a `BitDepth` that has been estimated.
If one use the following sparql query:
```sparql
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX ddhub: <http://ddhub.no/>
SELECT ?dataPoint 
WHERE {
			?dataPoint rdf:type ddhub:BitDepth .
}
```
one obtain the result:
```
dat#01 dat#02
```
If now the sparql query is:
```sparql
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX ddhub: <http://ddhub.no/>
SELECT ?dataPoint 
WHERE {
			?dataPoint rdf:type ddhub:BitDepth .
			?dataPoint ddhub:BelongsToClass ddhub:Measurement .
}
```
one obtain the result:
```
dat#01
```
