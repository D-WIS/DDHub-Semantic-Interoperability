Intro

  (Thank you to Jonathan Lightfoot and the ISCWSA for this information.)
  The work of the ISCWSA (SPE Wellbore Positioning Technical Section was put in place to help with Depth references and Quality Assurance. 
  The primary work was in the recent RP-78 workgroup to reduce the QA/QC of depth from a large section to a summary of requirements. 
  In addition, Depth was included in the discussion related to Well Origin (Surface Location). 
  They also worked with the OSDU to propose some data tables to establish mnemonics for all the WITS Levels in an effort to further standardize these values. 
  Most of the RP-78 work is related to wellbore positioning whereas the OSDU tables are a proposed reference as a starting point to make sure realtime data transmitted at the wellsite is better organized. 
  Most of it was based on common tables except for WITS Level 7, 8, & 9.
  Jonathon expanded the tables beyond thetraditional WITS-WITSML data levels.
  
  Jonathan also suggests that DWIS consider the IOGP data standards (attached), especially with respect to
  coordinate reference systems, vertical reference datums and wellbore positioning data standards. 
  The P7-17 document was recently updated and published and is a great reference for depth references used in wellbore construction.

  Summary
  
  The International Association of Oil & Gas Producers (IOGP) Geomatics Committee recommended an updated format to to enable 
  storing raw sensor measurement data, tool error models and uncertainties.  With respect to depth measurements:
      - Depth is the Distance of a point from a chosen vertical reference surface downward along a line that is perpendicular to that surface. 
        Note 1 to entry: The line direction may be straight, or be dependent on the Earth's gravity field or other physical phenomena.
        Note 2 to entry: A depth above the vertical reference surface will have a negative value. (ISO 19111). Colloquially, undesirably, 
        called “Z” in some applications.  Often referred to as TVD, TVDss, TVDMSL.
      - Gravity-related height is the height that is dependent on the Earth’s gravity field. 
        Note 1 to entry: This refers to, amongst others, orthometric height and Normal height, which are both approximations of the distance of a point 
        above the mean sea level, but also may include Normal-orthometric heights, dynamic heights or geopotential numbers. 
        Note 2 to entry: The distance from the reference surface may follow a curved line, not necessarily straight, as it is influenced by the direction 
        of gravity. (ISO 19111).
      - Ground level (GL) is a point on the structure.  Note issue with pad construction and subsidence. Typically not used as ZDP directly, 
        but in a two-step definition.
      - The Well Reference Point (WRP) is the horizontal origin of the wellbore, generally the location where the wellbore enters the earth. 
        The WRP is typically a physical point at or close to ground level (land rigs) or sea bed (offshore rigs). 
      - The Zero-depth Point (ZDP) is the operational observation reference for the measured depth (MD) measurements, often the Derrick Floor during drilling.
        The height (or 3D location) of the ZDP above the Vertical Reference Surface (e.g., mean sea level (MSL)) is recorded in the P7/17 file, as well as the measured depth 
        of the WRP below it
      - Coordinate Reference System (CRS)   --- TBD
      - Vertical Reference Surface          --- TBD
      - The Tie-in Point(TP) is a real survey station common to both the parent wellbore and the sidetrack. It is the last real, measured survey station 
        in the parent wellbore that is above the kick-off point.
      - The kick-off point (KOP), sometimes referred to as a window point, is intended to be the last ‘point’ in the parent wellbore before deviation. 
      - The Measured Depth (MD) is the along hole distance from the ZDP point to a point in the wellbore (meters or feet, as indicated).  
      - Total Depth (TD) is the distance (MD) from the ZDP to the end of the wellbore. 
      - Total Vertical Depths(TVD) is an ambiguous term which in general means the same as local depth (i.e., the vertical distance below the ZDP) 
        but can also mean depth below MSL.
      - Local Depth (d) is the third component of the local coordinates, positive in vertical “down” direction. Not the same as MD (which is along hole). 
  
 For additional terms and definitions see the table on page 44.
 
 Per Report 373-24 regarding vertical data in oil and gas applications addresses issues associated with vertical Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs), 
    in particular those related to coordinate operations (coordinate conversions and coordinate transformations) and metadata.
    
      - When referencing geological information to the measured well tracks the use of Driller’s depth and Logger’s depth may introduce inconsistencies 
        and need to be accounted for: Cores and drill cutting interpretations are referenced to depth observations measured along the drill string, the 
        so-called ‘Driller’s depth’. On the other hand, all data generated by logging runs have depth measured along the wireline used for logging, the 
        so-called ‘Logger’s depth’. The latter are generally more accurate given that the drill string is subject to much more tension than a wireline 
        used for logging. (See Fig.4, page 10)
      - There is no standard unit of measure for vertical coordinate reference systems. Hence, the unit of measure of the vertical coordinate reference
        system should always be recorded explicitly.
  
  Per Report 483-7 regarding wellbore positioning data exchange format, data file consists of three blocks: A common header, followed by a data format 
    specific header, followed by the data records.  Files that use this convention have a filename extension of *.P717.
        - Note that the convention uses a Record Extension Identifier defined by the initial format, and allows a user defined format  (see page 11)
          and there is a conditional additional parameter for additional attributes.  There may also be redundant data, often used for data integrity checks. 
          For semantic purposes, we should probably include information from Table 6, page 11:
            * Standard Record Extension <has> Record Extension Identifier
            * Standard Record Extension <has> Conditional Additional Parameter
            * Standard Record Extension <has> Extension Description
            * Standard Record Extension <has> Data Units Code
     We should first check with ISCWSA to make sure this is the correct interpretation of the standard.
     
     The Semantics workgroup should also note the "standard" includes many items regarding the well type, rig type, coordinate conversions and much more.  
     There is a lot of good information here.
