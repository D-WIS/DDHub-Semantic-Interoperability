## Signal definition
From [Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary](https://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/en/terms/m/mud_density)

> The mass per unit volume of a drilling fluid, synonymous with mud weight. Weight is reported in lbm/gal (also known as ppg), kg/m3 or g/cm3 (also called specific gravity or SG), lb/ft3 or in hydrostatic gradient, lb/in2/ft (psi/ft) or pptf (psi/1000 ft). Mud weight controls hydrostatic pressure in a wellbore and prevents unwanted flow into the well. The weight of the mud also prevents collapse of casing and the openhole. Excessive mud weight can cause lost circulation by propagating, and then filling, fractures in the rock. Mud weight (density) test procedures using a mud balance have been standardized and published by the API.

## Quantity
- The fluid density quantity is M L-3.
- SI unit is kg/m3.
- Common units are
  - sg

## Data representation
Mud density is a scalar and therefore represented as such. 
If dependency to pressure and/or temperature were represented, tabular versions would exist but it is never available.
